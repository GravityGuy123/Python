## Overview

This repository is organized into two main sections:

### Practices
The `Practices` folder contains various Python files used for learning and skill development, including:
- Fundamental Python concepts and syntax
- Algorithm implementations
- Data structure exercises
- Problem-solving practice
- Code challenges and experiments

### Projects
The `Projects` folder houses complete Python applications and projects, each in its own dedicated folder. These projects demonstrate practical application of Python skills in real-world scenarios.
