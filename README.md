## Overview

This repository is organized into two main sections:

### Practices
The `Practices` folder contains various Python files used for learning and skill development, including:
- Fundamental Python concepts and syntax
- Algorithm implementations
- Data structure exercises
- Problem-solving practice
- Code challenges and experiments

### Projects
The `Projects` folder houses complete Python applications and projects, each in its own dedicated folder. These projects demonstrate practical application of Python skills in real-world scenarios.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x installed on your system
- Basic understanding of Python programming

### Running the Code
1. Clone or download this repository
2. Navigate to the specific practice file or project folder you're interested in
3. Follow any additional setup instructions in individual project folders
4. Run Python files using: `python filename.py`

## Usage

- **For Learning**: Explore the `Practices` folder to see various Python concepts in action
- **For Projects**: Check out the `Projects` folder to see complete applications and their implementations
- Feel free to use any code as reference or learning material
