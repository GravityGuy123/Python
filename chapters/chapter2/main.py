# Practices

# Try It Yourself
# Write a separate program to accomplish each of these exercises. Save each program with a filename that follows standard Python conventions, using lowercase letters and underscores, such as simple_message.py and simple _messages.py.
# 2-1. Simple Message: Assign a message to a variable, and then print that message.
# 2-2. Simple Messages: Assign a message to a variable, and print that message. Then change the value of the variable to a new message, and print the new message.

# 2-1.
message = "Hi guys"
print(message)

# 2-2.
message2 = "Xup People"
print(message2)

message2 = "How you doing famz"
print(message2)
