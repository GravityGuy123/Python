# print(string1[0:])  # In this case, it gets the characters from index 0 to the end

# print(string1[10:]) # When the index indicated exceeds the available index, you get an empty space i.e nothing

# print(string1[:6]) # In this case, the end point was indicated to be 6 but we didn't indicate the start point, what it does is to start from the 1st index to the indicated end point


# print(string1[::2]) 
# In this case, we didn't declare the first two ":", Because we didn't declare the first ":" which is meant to indicate the starting point by default it tells the code to start slicing from the first value. The second ":" which is meant to indicate the end point by default it tells the code to end slicing at the last value. Finally, the 2 which is the 3rd value it takes is telling the code to count 1 index and start at the 2nd.

# NB: Strings are immutable, meaning they cannot be changed after they are created. However, you can create a new string based on the original one with modifications.
